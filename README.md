# Wine_Os
The plan for our machine learning model using tensor flow implements input variables as red and white wine data
The  output will determine which wines are highest in quality using the nueral network nodes as metrics of fixed acidity, alchohol content, and sulphates 
This model will be conduscted as a supervised ML model because we want to accept or reject the hypotheis that white wine is healthier than red wine based on our criteria.
