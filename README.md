It's one of the most famous either/or questions, a restless debate and one that garners fierce loyalists on both teams. A simple question, yet has a multitude of varying responses as to why someone would prefer a glass of red versus white. There may be a never ending set of answers as to why one prefers one type versus the other. However, today we set aside our differences to focus one solving deeper and understanding a greater complexity when it comes to when-its healthiness. While we largely rely on one of our five senses, taste, to largely determine our liking for wine, we look to explore on a more granular level the chemical makeup of wine and which one essentially is deemed the healthier option for people. 

Winemaking is a multi-billion dollar industry, an alchoholic beverage that has proven throughout centuries to be a popular global commoditiy.
