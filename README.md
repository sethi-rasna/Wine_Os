# Wine_Os
The plan for our machine learning model using tensor flow implements input variables as red and white wine data
The  output will determine which wines are highest in quality using the neural network nodes as metrics of fixed acidity, alchohol content, sulphates, and residual sugars 
This model will be conducted as a supervised ML model because we want to accept or reject the hypothesis that red wine is healthier and tastier because of higher residual sugar than white wine based on our criteria.
