# Wine_Os

## An overview introduction to our Wine_Os project:
What does make the quality of **“Vinho Verde”** so unique:
“Vino Verde” (literally “green wine”) is not a grape type. **“Green”** means young rather than anything to do with its color.  
It is known that a single glass of wine contains thousands of different chemical compounds which determine its quality. We are to find out what thing or things that really make a Vinho Verde a Vinho Verde.  Is it that it comes from the Vinho Verde region or the chemical compounds that are associated with this unique young wine quality and taste.

By using Machine Learning models, we will try to predict Vinho Verde’s quality, taste and price based on its chemical composite such as, acidity, sulfur, sulphates, and alcohol content.  We will compare Vinho Verde red and white. 

### In our prediction model the following modules (but not limited to) will be used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- sklearn
