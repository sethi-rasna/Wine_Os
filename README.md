It's one of the most famous either/or questions, a restless debate and one that garners fierce loyalists on both teams. A simple question, yet has a multitude of varying responses as to why someone would prefer a glass of red versus white. There may be a never ending set of answers as to why one prefers one type versus the other. However, today we set aside our differences to focus on solving deeper and understanding a greater complexity when it comes one factor-its healthiness. While we rely on one of our five senses, taste, to largely determine our liking for wine, we look to explore on a more granular level the chemical makeup of wine and which one essentially is deemed the healthier option for people. 

Winemaking is a multi-billion dollar industry, an assembly creating an alchoholic beverage that has proven throughout centuries to become a staple commodity product. We investigate a number of physicochemical variables to determine how largely red and white wine differ. Ultimately, through our data exploration and analysis, determine which wine is the healthier option for consumption. For our study, we will be utlizing data focusing on the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, one of the most famous wine varities of Portugal, to determine if we are able to arrive at a conclusion.
