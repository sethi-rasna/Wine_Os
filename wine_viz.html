            What makes the quality of "Vinho Verde" so unique?<br><br>Vinho Verde derives from one of the oldest regions in Portugal and one of the largest wine centers in Europe. Its literal translation "green wine" means young rather than having anything to do with its color. Our goal is to determine what characteristics make either the red or white Vinho Verde wines the best in terms of healthiness and quality.<br>

    </div>  

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
            Before diving into our investigation and research questions, let us take a step back to further understand a few of the exploratory variables that are essential in the wine making process.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:red">Sulfates</h3>
        <p>
            The presence of sulfates on labels can sometimes worry consumers. However, its pros in wine are crucial to the consumption and longevity of the wine stored in the bottle itself. Sulfates help to prevent wine from browning, a process that alters a wine's color and flavor. They aid in minimizing the oxidation in wine and maintain its freshness. Wines with lower acidity need more sulfites than higher acidity wines. Other benefits of sulfates in wine include preventing the growth of unwanted microorganisms, promoting the growth of yeast for better fermentation, and improving the release of desirable compounds from grapes.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:rgb(58, 145, 216)">Acidity and pH</h3>
        <p>
            Wine acidity greatly affects its flavor and aroma in several ways. Wines that present high acidity have a sharper taste. It affects how wine sits in one's stomach, with higher acid content naturally causing a higher risk of indigestion and the acid reflux. Fixed and volatile acidity tells us the concentration of acids present in wine. pH levels inform us of the intensity of acids present.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:brown">Residual Sugar</h3>
        <p>
            Residual sugars are natural grape sugars that are not converted into alcohol during the fermentation process. Residual sugar content after fermentation is inversely proportionate to the alcohol level. Meaning that higher alcohol wines contain less sugar, while low alcohol wines have more sugar. The residual sugar amount is measured in grams per liter (g/L) and will affect a wines' sweetness.   
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:midnightblue">Alcohol Content</h3>
        <p>
            The process that makes a wine an alcoholic beverage is called fermentation. It is the fermentation of grapes using yeast. Veraison, the process that ripens the grapes that produces sugar, combined with fermentation, transforms the sugars present in grapes into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Essentially, the higher the sugar levels in the grape, the higher the alcohol levels in the wine. 
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:green">Density</h3>
        <p>
            The density of wine is primarily determined by the concentration of alcohol.
